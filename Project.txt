Weather based insurance prototype needs to be created. The main idea is following.
I need to indemnify for rain in a certain day and place. As a user I have to visit a web page, type name, city, email and day and pay insurance fixed cost (0.01 Ether). Then an email is sent to previously specified email address confirming policy purchase (the email should contain a link to transaction in blockchain).
 If the rain happens in specified day (e.g. you can emulate data collection from weather.com) the user will receive 0.1 Ether insurance benefit and confirmation with a link to transaction.   
 
Please confirm that you’ve received this email and let me know if you have any questions.
 
Once finished please share a link to your Github repository with the code. We would appreciate if you do it before 10 am Minsk time (12:30 IST).
 
Let’s schedule a meeting on Monday to discuss the results.  Does 17:00 IST work for you?
